Beware code bad


### Number Systems:
- Convert binary to decimal
- Convert decimal to binary
- Convert floating point decimal to binary

more to come

### Coding Systems
- Convert decimal to binary coded decimal [BCD]
- Convert binary to gray code
- Convert gray code to binary

### Complements
- Compute (r-1)'s complement for decimal.
